<p>If you waited to buy your ticket to <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2016</a> in Vienna, you may be out of luck. The event sold out on December 31, 2015. All 1550 tickets, including 50 micro-sponsorship tickets are now gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re currently at full capacity of our venue, but working towards expanding by hiring more halls in the MuzeumQuartier so we can meet the strong demand,&#8221; organizer Petya Raykovska told the Tavern.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will try and release 200 more tickets in the days to follow, depending on the availability of the halls around the MQ,&#8221; she said. A <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-europe-is-sold-out-sign-up-for-the-tickets-waiting-list/" target="_blank">waiting list</a> is now open for those hopeful to grab a ticket when more venue space opens up. According to Raykovska, the list already has nearly 100 signups.</p>
<p>Based on the attendees confirmed so far, WordCamp Europe 2016 will have 58 countries represented, which is six more than the event had in 2014 and 2015. Including micro-sponsor tickets, the countries with the highest number of attendees include Germany (8%), Netherlands (8%), UK (8%), Austria (7%), and the United States (6%).</p>
<p>Planning early has paid off for the organizing team with another year of successful ticket sales in the bag. Raykovska attributes this to the location and the quality of past WCEU events.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, Vienna being central for Europe and a fabulous location, has helped us attract more people this year,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;But I believe above all, the huge interest is a testament about the quality we&#8217;ve been able to provide in previous years, establishing WordCamp Europe as a can&#8217;t-miss event for anyone running or involved with a WordPress business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also think people appreciate that we released tickets so early. More than 80% of WordCamp Europe attendees come from outside the host country so being able to plan early helped people make a decision,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/the-call-for-speakers-for-wceu-2016-closes-in-4-weeks/" target="_blank">call for speakers</a> will close on January 31st. Speakers will be notified by March 16th as to whether or not their session will be on the schedule.</p>

Jenny Beaumont is co-organizer of WordCamp Paris &amp; WordCamp Europe, a frequent speaker at WordCamps in France and abroad, and a contributor to a number of blogs. After 17 years building things in and around the web, she is taking a year-long sabbatical to get a new outlook on life.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you‚Äôve organized a WordCamp or similar event, then you know the work involved in managing a call for papers. With every submission comes lots of information, both about the candidate and the proposed talk. And with some candidates submitting multiple proposals, the total number of submissions can be 3-4 times the number of slots available.</p>
<p>The call for speakers for <a href="https://paris.wordcamp.org/2016/" target="_blank">WordCamp Paris 2016</a> brought in upwards of 70 candidates and over 100 proposals!</p>
<p>In the past, most WordCamps have taken proposals through online forms and then organized them within spreadsheets for deliberation. But just as WordCamp Paris has grown in recent years, so has the organizing team, and the spreadsheet method became increasingly laborious and inefficient.</p>
<h3>There‚Äôs a plugin for that</h3>
<p>While preparing for <a href="https://paris.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Paris 2015</a>, the organizers decided to tackle this problem, and turned to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-idea-stream/" target="_blank">WP Idea Stream</a>, a plugin developed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/imath" target="_blank">Mathieu Viet</a> (who has since joined the organizing team).</p>
<p>As the name suggests, WP Idea Stream is a collaborative tool built for the purpose of sharing and managing ideas between members of a WordPress site. A close look shows us that this simple concept contains a lot of intricate and useful features.</p>
<h3>Advantages for users</h3>
<p>Filling out a form one time is no trouble, but what if you want to submit multiple proposals? Or, what if you‚Äôre interrupted while filling out a form and have to start over?</p>
<p>WP Idea Stream solves this problem by giving talk candidates a simple one-time sign-up. With their own account they can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update their personal information at any time (name, biography, social media accounts, email address, phone number, etc)</li>
<li>Submit multiple proposals without needing to resubmit personal information</li>
<li>Edit each proposal for up to one hour after submission</li>
<li>Access and consult their submissions at any time</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advantages for organizers</h3>
<p>Some team members wait until closing to sit and evaluate the proposals in one go, while others prefer to react over time as talks roll in. How do you keep track of those you‚Äôve seen? How do you exchange thoughts and opinions with your teammates? How do you navigate through all of this information?</p>
<h3>Vote</h3>
<p>WP Idea Stream uses a five-star rating system to vote on ideas (or talks in our case). This makes it easy to see which are the most popular among a large group of organizers.</p>
<p>The plugin settings page includes an easy way to customize the wording for each level.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hover-captions.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50387"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hover-captions.png?resize=1025%2C133" alt="hover-captions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50387" /></a></p>
<h3>Comment and debate</h3>
<p>To compliment this voting system, organizers can leave comments on each submission to further bolster their argument for or against a talk. They also have the opportunity to point out information that might be lacking, ask questions of the candidate, or make notes of recurring themes that emerge.</p>
<h3>Track and filter</h3>
<p>As an administrator, there are two ways to view talk proposals: the main ‚Äúpost‚Äù view, and a view from within your own profile.</p>
<p><strong>The ‚Äúpost‚Äù view</strong> is much like the default blog home page on a standard WordPress site. Submissions are listed in chronological descending order by default, including pagination and a display of the total number of talks to date. Then, there is the possibility to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search by keyword</li>
<li>Filter by votes (highest ratings first)</li>
<li>Filter by most commented</li>
</ul>
<p>The excerpt for each talk submission includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The avatar of the candidate (candidates are encouraged to use the email address associated with their Gravatar account at sign up)</li>
<li>The name of the talk</li>
<li>The number of comments with a quick link to that section of the talk</li>
<li>The current average rating, with a quick link to vote on that talk</li>
<li>An excerpt of the talk description</li>
<li>A list of all category and tag selections</li>
<li>The date of submission</li>
<li>A quick link to edit the proposal in the WordPress admin</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/excerpts.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50389"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/excerpts.png?resize=1025%2C778" alt="excerpts" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50389" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The ‚Äúprofile‚Äù view</strong> is intended for subscribed users to view their own submissions and to manage their personal information. As an admin, this front-end view also includes some very useful tabs to help keep track of your participation in the deliberation process.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-view.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50390"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-view.png?resize=1025%2C737" alt="profile-view" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50390" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Published.</strong> Shows any and all submissions you might have made. Yes, WordCamp Paris organizers are also often speakers!</li>
<li><strong>Commented.</strong> Shows all talk proposals that you‚Äôve already commented on.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluated.</strong> Shows all talk proposals that you‚Äôve already voted on.</li>
<li><strong>To be evaluated.</strong> Shows all talk proposals that are still awaiting your vote.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Organize</h3>
<p>By default, WP Idea Stream comes with standard WordPress category and tag taxonomies, allowing submissions to be further classified and qualified. This year for WordCamp Paris, we used categories to represent three talk formats: 10, 20 and 30-minute preferences.</p>
<p>We use tags for what we call talk ‚Äúzooms‚Äù (basically just thematic tags). The advantage here is that, just like standard WordPress tags, users can be prompted with ‚Äúmost used‚Äù keywords to describe their talk‚Äôs theme.</p>
<p>Categories and tags have quick links to filter the view by those terms.</p>
<p>This has proven extremely useful for spotting recurring subjects and trends, comparing similar proposals, and even for figuring out subjects that haven‚Äôt been covered that we might want to find speakers for.</p>
<h3>Export</h3>
<p>When it comes down to it, you can‚Äôt get around the good old-fashioned spreadsheet for finalizing the job.</p>
<p>Once the team has finished rating all of the talks, the submissions can be easily exported to a spreadsheet, and sorted by vote, theme, and talk duration. From here, the program is built up and finalized, and the bulk of the work is already done.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Using WP Idea Stream does requires us to have and maintain a WordPress installation separate from our official WordCamp site, but this is also proving to have a number of advantages including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dedicated domain for emails</li>
<li>A permanent site that can act as a long-term archive, essentially regrouping information and links to each year‚Äôs dedicated site</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>WP Idea Stream doesn‚Äôt work like this out-of-the-box. Many of these features were built specifically for our purposes. Because the plugin is developed to be highly extensible, adapting it for your own needs is relatively easy.</p>
<h3>Templates</h3>
<p>WP Idea Stream is built with a templating system, allowing you to easily override any of the front-end views from your own theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/templates.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50392"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/templates.png?resize=398%2C506" alt="templates" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50392" /></a></p>
<h3>Custom functions</h3>
<p>Placing a file named <a href="https://github.com/imath/wc-talk#wordcamp-talk" target="_blank">wp-idea-stream-custom.php</a> in wp-content/plugins/ extends the plugin, allowing you to build on the default functionality.</p>
<p>Here are some of the features we‚Äôve added to adapt the plugin to our needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish the content (talks) in private mode</li>
<li>Extended user fields, including language preference (the site then displays by default in the preferred language)</li>
<li>Time limit for editing talk submissions</li>
<li>Front-end admin tabs for viewing submissions by those rated and those still needing to be rated</li>
<li>Back-end modifications so that the plugin name and icon are changed in the admin menu.</li>
<li>Added a metabox with additional checkboxes to further classify talks by targeted audience</li>
<li>Added user role of ‚Äúspeaker,‚Äù essentially with the same permissions as the standard ‚Äúsubscriber‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also added a fun little function in case any candidates try to sneak a peek by hacking the site‚Äôs comment RSS feed:</p>
<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">
/**
 * Redirect the speaker trying to cheat by adding the feed argument to the talk url :)
 */
function wc_talk_neutralize_feeds_step_two() {
	if ( is_feed() &amp;&amp; wp_idea_stream_is_ideastream() ) {
		wp_idea_stream_add_message( array(
			'type'    =&gt; 'info',
			'content' =&gt; __( 'Ah! caught trying to spy!', 'wc-talk' ),
		) );
		wp_safe_redirect( wp_idea_stream_get_redirect_url() );
		exit();
	}
}
</pre>
<p>We have used this system for two consecutive years now, improving the functionality as we learn what features are needed to make the process as smooth and efficient as possible. Overall, we might actually spend more time on the process, but it‚Äôs qualitative time. These tools humanize the process, allowing us to easily navigate the information and further invest ourselves in both the candidates and their ideas.</p>

Measure Jetpack is an independent, comprehensive series of benchmarks that will show how much impact Jetpack has on a site&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, little information has been shared on the project&#8217;s status. I reached out to Liuiza for an update, &#8220;We&#8217;ve built a decent set of sample data for testing and hope to begin actual testing next week. The plan is to have all the data by the end of the month and publish some of the results in February,&#8221; Liuiza told the Tavern.</p>
<p>While the results are not likely to be conclusive, the benchmarks will be an important resource in an area where similar data is scarce.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-contact-forms/" target="_blank">Custom Contact Forms</a> has just passed one million downloads after nearly six years in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Last year <a href="https://taylorlovett.com/" target="_blank">Taylor Lovett</a>, Director of Web Engineering at <a href="http://10up.com/" target="_blank">10up</a>, released version 6.0, a completely rewritten version that made it one of the first plugins to incorporate the new WP REST API. It is now one of the most popular plugins to do so and has more than 70,000 active installs.</p>
<p>The plugin was built to provide the best user experience possible for building forms. It is unique in that it puts the form creation process inside the media manager, instead of a separate forms admin page. Custom Contact Forms also offers live previews while the user is building a form.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/custom-contact-form-creation.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50367"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/custom-contact-form-creation.png?resize=900%2C445" alt="custom-contact-form-creation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50367" /></a></p>
<p>Getting the REST API integrated with the plugin was the culmination of nine months of development for version 6.0. Unlike many other early plugins that rely on the API, Custom Contact Forms does not require the WP REST API plugin. Instead, the plugin includes its own version of the WP REST API, which is cleverly activated if necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plugin includes a small fraction of that code,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;Compressed it is 1.6MB and the whole thing is built to be very performant scale for enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good user experience to make 70,000 people install a plugin dependency,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;The main thing about CCF is it has an attractive fully JS powered interface that looks like the WP media modal. It really goes with Matt&#8217;s message at the State of the Word on JS.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would argue the user experience is better than all the popular alternatives (Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, etc.) The plugin does not have as much functionality as GF or Ninja Forms but is quickly catching up &#8211; it&#8217;s also 100% free,&#8221; Lovett said.</p>
<p>Since Custom Contact Forms is capable of handling much more than simple contact forms, Lovett is considering a name change that will help people understand the broader possibilities for its use. He has seen it used for employment forms, product creation (the plugin has extensive hooks and can create posts on each submission), digital product creation, and event creation.</p>
<h3>JavaScript-Powered Form Creation is the Future</h3>
<p>Lovett believes that the most popular forms plugins will need to adapt in order to keep pace with the modern web.</p>
<p>&#8220;By using the REST API and heavy JS, CCF can do things like live form previews which Gravity Forms and Ninja Forms can&#8217;t do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The modern web requires things to be done without page reloads so I do think the traditional form plugins will need to modernize. The only thing standing in their way is time &#8211; I spent nine months rewriting CCF for the JSON REST API,&#8221; Lovett said.</p>
<p>&#8220;AJAX has become expected on the web. Anything less is not going to stand the test of time. Can you imagine using the media modal, if you had to reload the page every time you added an image? The same concept applies to forms,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Custom Contact Forms is not as full-featured as the most popular contact forms, and Lovett says he gets quite a bit of pressure from users to add more features.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tastefully add features slowly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think a lot of plugins try to do all the things and I don&#8217;t want CCF to be like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lovett plans to add Paypal and Stripe integration along with a variety of form templates in future releases. When asked if these would be separate add-ons, he said that they would mostly likely be built in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only reason to separate things in my opinion is to make money off of them,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;The plugin will still be a small file size and performant &#8211; so why separate?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lovett has struggled to maintain a high rating on Custom Contact Forms, as it went through a tough transition in order to adapt the JSON REST API.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to write DB upgrade scripts for thousands of people using the old plugin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;During that transition, I got a lot of 1-star reviews.&#8221; The database upgrade scripts provided a seamless transition for some users but not for others. This is sometimes the price users pay when a plugin updates to be on the cutting edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;The JSON REST API being merged into core has made support much easier,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs &#8216;fringe technology&#8217; anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>WordPress 4.5 development is now in full swing with Mike Schroder at the helm, leading the <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1452114055008649" target="_blank">kickoff meeting</a> today. Schroder is joined by newly named deputies, Mel Choyce and Adam Silverstein, who will help manage the release.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-5-project-schedule/" target="_blank">4.5 project schedule</a> is now posted. The merge window for feature plugins opens February 3rd and the first Beta is expected the last week of that month. April 12th is the target date for the official release.</p>
<p>The call for feature plugins is beginning early this time around and a Feature Plugin chat is scheduled for Tuesday, January 12, 2016, 3:00 PM CST.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main purpose of the early chat is for plugins that believe they are ready for merge, and to start up new ones for future releases,&#8221; Schroder said. Those who have ideas and/or plugins to put forward will have an opportunity to get feedback from other contributors.</p>
<p>During the kickoff meeting, Schroder took stock of the general areas that contributors have shown interest in working on for WordPress 4.5. Weston Ruter and other contributors on the customizer component have several features in progress, including <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32296" target="_blank">Customize Pane Resizer</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31195" target="_blank">Customize Device Preview</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34893" target="_blank">Customize Setting Validation</a>, and the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34923" target="_blank">creation of page stubs for adding nav menu items</a>. Ruter considers the Transactions and Selective Refresh features ready to go for consideration in 4.5.</p>
<p>Michael Arestad said that he is exploring &#8220;a series of smaller projects that can make Post New and the publishing process a bit nicer.&#8221; Joe McGill is hoping to make progress on improving the compression of resized images in core. John Blackbourn expressed interest in working with a team on<br />
&#8220;No More Mixed Content&#8221; https improvements.</p>
<p>More detailed discussion about potential feature plugins for 4.5 (and future releases) will happen in the scheduled chat next week.</p>

It&#8217;s the type of bold, non-flashy theme that puts the spotlight on content and images without trying to stuff widgets into the reading experience.</p>
<p>Briar was created by the folks at <a href="http://slicejack.com/" target="_blank">Slicejack</a>, a Croatia-based development company and a brand new WordPress.org theme author. The theme uses the Bootstrap framework to provide a responsive layout for desktop, tablets, and mobile.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/briar-screenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50293"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/briar-screenshot.png?resize=1025%2C769" alt="briar-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50293" /></a></p>
<p>One of Briar&#8217;s most interesting features is the ability for users to create a full-width heading using a shortcode. The content and background image specified in the shortcode will have a parallax effect, which you can see when scrolling on single posts.</p>
<p>The theme&#8217;s primary menu can be toggled into view using the hamburger icon. It includes support for multi-level navigation.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/multi-level-navigation.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-50316"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/multi-level-navigation.gif?resize=600%2C334" alt="multi-level-navigation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50316" /></a></p>
<p>Briar also has a unique fixed footer with post meta that disappears as you scroll down the page. On mobile the post meta is pared down to just the author and post date.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/briar-post.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50299"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/briar-post.png?resize=1025%2C492" alt="briar-post" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50299" /></a></p>
<p>The theme supports more than a dozen customization options for colors, backgrounds, layouts, and social buttons. Its elegant layout and color selections are some of the nicest customizer controls  I&#8217;ve seen in recently launched themes. The layout controls allow you to select from three different options for the home, blog, single, archive, category archive, search, 404, and default page templates. Briar includes six prepared color schemes as well as 15 different color pickers for customizing individual elements of the theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/customizer-layouts.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-50319"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/customizer-layouts.jpg?resize=1025%2C612" alt="customizer-layouts" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50319" /></a></p>
<p>The theme supports an optional sidebar widget area, which will appear on the templates where you assign a layout with a sidebar. If you&#8217;re using Jetpack, you can enable the infinite scrolling module without having any conflicts.</p>
<p>Briar&#8217;s design provides excellent readability with contrasting fonts &#8211; Noto sans for headlines and Martel for paragraph text.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://demo.slicejack.com/briar/" target="_blank">live demo</a> at SliceJack to see the theme in action with the single-column layout.</p>
<p>Briar is Slicejack&#8217;s first free theme but they have another in the pipeline for approval. The theme is <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/briar/" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a> and is also hosted on <a href="https://github.com/themejack/briar" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you&#8217;re looking to restart your blog in 2016 with a no-frills, content-focused WordPress theme, Briar fits the bill.</p>

<p>It also adds a setting to the user profile screen where users can choose whether the default behavior of WordPress is to view the content or continue editing after clicking the save button.</p>

<p>Whitis was inspired to create the plugin after editing large volumes of content and revisions on a regular basis. Destination after save can also increase performance on large WordPress Multisite installations by reducing page loads, &#8220;If you are paying for web hosting based on usage, reducing the number of page loads in this way could have a real effect on the cost of bandwidth if thousands or millions of users are producing content,&#8221; Whitis told the Tavern.</p>
<p>One thing I discovered during testing is that content with long titles are cut off because of the drop-down menu location. Other than that, it works as expected on WordPress 4.5 alpha. Whether it&#8217;s creating, editing, or doing repetitive tasks to manage content, destination after save can save you some time. Destination after save is free and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/destination-after-save/">available for download</a> from the WordPress plugin directory.</p>

<p>Cloud hosting provider <a href="http://status.linode.com/incidents/mmdbljlglnfd" target="_blank">Linode has been combatting DDoS attacks</a> since Christmas Day, which have caused multiple disruptions and service outages across its global data centers. The attacks are ongoing and the company is struggling to keep its status blog up to notify customers.</p>
<p>In addition to the DDoS attacks, <a href="http://status.linode.com/incidents/ghdlhfnfngnh" target="_blank">Linode has also confirmed a data security breach</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A security investigation into the unauthorized login of three accounts has led us to the discovery of two Linode.com user credentials on an external machine. This implies user credentials could have been read from our database, either offline or on, at some point. The user table contains usernames, email addresses, securely hashed passwords and encrypted two-factor seeds. The resetting of your password will invalidate the old credentials.</p></blockquote>
<p>All Linode Manager passwords have been expired as a precaution after customer credentials were found in the wild. The team is working around the clock to mitigate the DDoS attacks and further investigate the unauthorized access to customer accounts. Linode has not yet determined whether there is a link between the two attacks.</p>
<p>Several days ago, WP Engine <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-identifies-cloud-infrastructure-providers-as-entry-point-for-recent-security-breach" target="_blank">identified its cloud infrastructure provider as the entry point for the company&#8217;s recent security breach</a>. The company is listed as one of Linode&#8217;s customers. Jason Cohen, the company&#8217;s founder and CTO, jumped in to answer several <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-identifies-cloud-infrastructure-providers-as-entry-point-for-recent-security-breach#comments" target="_blank">questions in WP Tavern comments</a> earlier today but would neither confirm nor deny that Linode is the cloud infrastructure provider in question.</p>
<p>PagerDuty, a former Linode customer and <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/july-2015-security-announcement/" target="_blank">victim of a similar attack</a>, speculates that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10845985" target="_blank">Linode may have been compromised since July 2015</a> and is only now announcing it:</p>
<blockquote><p>We immediately reached out to them not only to inform them of their compromise, but to assist them in investigating it. We were confident that the Linode database had been breached, and that the secret key used to encrypt information in the database had been compromised as well.</p>
<p>In addition to reaching out to Linode, we also worked with a third-party security firm to audit our work done during the incident. Likewise, around the same time we reached out to law enforcement to assist in investigating the attack. We did not get confirmation in July that there was a breach of the Linode Manager or any associated credentials.</p></blockquote>
<p>PagerDuty migrated away from Linode in August because of this breach, but the company was not allowed to disclose to its customers that Linode was the point of entry.</p>
<p>WP Engine&#8217;s security breach is strikingly similar, as the company&#8217;s attacker bypassed multiple layers of authentication to gain access to an administrative panel. According to Cohen, &#8220;the criminal‚Äôs behavior in this exposure matches a pattern seen in other attacks throughout 2015.&#8221;</p>
<p>If multiple Linode customers have been affected and are unable to reveal the point of entry, they may have put pressure on the cloud hosting provider to finally publicly disclose the nature of the attack.</p>
<p>In an age when nearly every hosting provider will have attacks and service disruptions, what matters is how they handle it and communicate with their customers. Linode has been plagued by <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/03/bitcoins-worth-228000-stolen-from-customers-of-hacked-webhost/">multiple</a> <a href="https://blog.linode.com/2013/04/16/security-incident-update/" target="_blank">security</a> <a href="https://blog.linode.com/2014/01/19/an-old-system-and-a-swat-team/" target="_blank">issues</a> in the past. Failure to disclose incidents in a timely way can be costly, especially in the current competitive hosting market where transparency with customers is at a premium.</p>
<p>When Linode&#8217;s investigation of the criminal activity is complete, it would be appropriate for them to disclose how long they knew about this compromise and when they first acted on it.

<p>The WordPress.org Theme Review Team has just wrapped up a busy year of adding new themes, approving updates, and overhauling procedures. In 2015, the team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/01/04/happy-new-year-thank-you/" target="_blank">reviewed and approved 910 new themes</a> with the help of 236 reviewers, according to TRT member Ulrich Pogson.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, the team cannot keep up with the massive influx of themes. The queue has been bogged down by submissions from authors whose themes have not been run against <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test" target="_blank">Theme Unit Test Data</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/" target="_blank">Theme Check Plugin</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of 2015, some <a href="http://wptavern.com/why-some-theme-authors-are-waiting-two-months-or-more-for-their-first-review" target="_blank">theme authors were waiting two or more months</a> before their first review. One of the reasons, according to TRT member Justin Tadlock, is that many of the themes submitted are far from ready to be approved upon their initial review.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe majority of themes submitted don‚Äôt follow the guidelines, which considerably slows down the process,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Themes will often have 20-30 issues or more. If we can get to a point where the majority of submissions only have a few minor issues, we really wouldn‚Äôt have a queue.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Automation is Coming Soon</h3>
<p>The Theme Review Team made a number of controversial decisions at the beginning of 2015, including the move to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options" target="_blank">require theme authors to use the customizer for building theme options</a>. Negative pushback from the community came to a head when the team started cracking down on <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-is-cracking-down-on-violations-of-the-presentation-vs-functionality-guideline" target="_blank">violations of the presentation vs. functionality guideline</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of May, Matt Mullenweg joined in on the Theme Review Team&#8217;s slack channel and challenged them to look at the review process and directory in a new way, opening up new avenues for the team to pursue in <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-seeks-feedback-on-the-review-process-themes-and-the-directory" target="_blank">improving that experience</a>. This was a watershed moment for the Theme Review Team that resulted in the unanimous approval of <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-unanimously-approves-roadmap-to-improve-directory-and-review-process" target="_blank">a new roadmap to improve the directory and review process</a>.</p>
<p>The team is now <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/07/automation-here-we-come/" target="_blank">moving towards more automation</a>, the first item on the roadmap, starting with auto-approval of theme updates. Automation will make a major impact on the time themes spend in the queue. The team has yet to implement it fully, because they&#8217;re still putting the code in place to improve the system.</p>
<h3>2015 Theme Review Team Milestones</h3>
<p>Despite delays on the roadmap, the Theme Review Team implemented many excellent changes during 2015, especially pertaining to education and documentation. In February, the team <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-handbook-updated-to-include-design-recommendations" target="_blank">updated the Theme Review Handbook to include design recommendations</a>. These recommendations were created to encourage design feedback on submissions to the directory and are formatted to help the theme author think more critically about design decisions.</p>
<p>Following the new requirement for WordPress.org themes to use the customizer for creating options, the TRT rallied, putting together more customizer resources and documentation. Nick Halsey assisted the team by updating the Theme Developer Handbook with <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-developer-handbook-updated-with-comprehensive-guide-to-the-customizer-api" target="_blank">a comprehensive guide to the customizer API</a>. The team also began <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-launches-code-examples-library-on-github" target="_blank">curating a library of code examples on GitHub for theme developers</a>, with the first section devoted to customizer code.</p>
<p>When WordPress 4.3 added the site icons feature, the Theme Review Team began working with authors to <a href="http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support" target="_blank">phase out favicon support</a> in themes. By the time WordPress 4.5 rolls around, all themes hosted in the official directory should be on track to use the core-supported method of adding site icons.</p>
<p>In July, the team <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-votes-to-allow-themes-to-use-the-rest-api-plugin" target="_blank">voted to allow themes to use the WP REST API plugin</a>, officially welcoming these new types of themes into the directory.</p>
<p>Throughout 2015, the Theme Review team moved quickly to navigate new waters as WordPress core improved. All of these initiatives and resources were created in addition to the 910 new themes that were reviewed and added to the directory. This is remarkable, given that the team is primarily made up of volunteers.</p>
<p>With the improved tools coming in 2016, WordPress.org theme authors can expect faster reviews, freeing up more time for reviewers to focus on improving the directory, creating more educational resources, and mentoring new reviewers.</p>

<li>Automattic employees made up 20.4% of all commits</li>
<li>Employees of 10up represented 18.8% of all commits</li>

<p>A WordPress core committer is someone who has access to merge code into the WordPress code base, used by millions of people. It&#8217;s an enormous responsibility and a recognition of trust, quality, and activity.</p>
<p>In WordPress&#8217; early years, the number of people with commit access consisted of just a handful of people. In 2010, Matt Mullenweg, Co-Founder of the WordPress project, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/01/12/dd32-whatcha-gonna-do/">started the process</a> of expanding that number, &#8220;One of the goals for the team in 2010 is to greatly expand the number of people with direct commit access, so the emphasis is more on review and collaboration,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There are a myriad of titles given to people involved in the WordPress project. Here are the main titles used to describe those contributing to core.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release Lead is a temporary title given to those who are leading a WordPress release cycle.</li>
<li>Lead Developers are those who influence the project&#8217;s direction and are highly involved in the decision-making process.</li>
<li>Core Developers are permanent committers.</li>
<li>Contributing Developers are guest committers, feature plugin lead developers, and¬†other contributors highlighted by the release lead.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to increasing the number of people with commit access, it&#8217;s important to recognize the employment of those individuals. In WordPress&#8217; early days, some people were concerned that too many Automattic employees with commit access meant that the company owned and controlled the project. WordPress development only served the commercial interests of Automattic.</p>
<p>Hou-Sand√≠&#8217;s statistic that 22 out of the 35 core committers are not employed by Automattic is proof that this isn&#8217;t the case. It also disproves the theory that Automattic owns and controls WordPress. To say that <strong>Automattic is WordPress</strong> is false and a slap in the face to the countless number of people who contribute to the project.</p>

<p><a href="https://2016.miami.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Miami 2016</a> organizers are ramping up for their 8th event to be held February 19-21 at the Florida International University School of Business. Ptah Dunbar is stepping up as the lead organizer for the event, which is expected to draw more than 700 attendees.</p>
<p>BuddyCamp Miami will kick off the event on the 19th, led by John James Jacoby who will be sharing on the current state of BuddyPress.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLast year I think organizers and speakers were impressed with the developer-related talks and how many people were learning first-hand what BuddyPress can do.‚Äù organizer David Bisset said. ‚ÄúThis year we are hoping to do that plus explore how others are using BuddyPress (in building websites and plugins) beyond the obvious ways it can be used.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordCamp Miami will also host its usual Beginner&#8217;s workshop and will continue its How-To track, which received positive reviews last year. Speakers will continue the camp&#8217;s new tradition of going directly to the Happiness Bar to answer questions after their talks.</p>
<h3>New ‚ÄúLearn JavaScript Deeply‚Äù Track</h3>
<p>In response to Matt Mullenweg urging developers to learn JavaScript, WordCamp Miami will be hosting its first ‚ÄúLearn JavaScript Deeply‚Äù track for attendees on Sunday, February 21st.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe track is very much setup as an almost full day workshop with a great local developer Michael Schofield hosting,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;As it‚Äôs planned now, the day starts off with several speakers introducing the required tools for working with JavaScript and WordPress. From there we explore the more advanced aspects of JavaScript while touching on frameworks such as BackBone, AngularJS, and React.‚Äù</p>
<p>WordPress developers Josh Pollock, Camden Segal, and Kevin Stover will be presenting along with local and surprise speakers. Attendees will receive resources after the event that they can use to continue learning and writing code.</p>
<h3>New Freelancer‚Äôs Workshop</h3>
<p>In 2015, WordCamp Miami hosted a general workshop day for more than 300 attendees. This year the conference will host a <a href="https://2016.miami.wordcamp.org/2016/01/03/announcing-our-freelance-workshop-february-19th/" target="_blank">Freelancer&#8217;s Workshop</a> on February 19th.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have so many freelancers (or people wishing to jump into freelancing) in South Florida, it seemed like a no-brainer once we clearly saw that the number of speaker submissions would support such a workshop,‚Äù organizer David Bisset said.</p>
<p>The workshop will cover subjects like pricing strategies, branding yourself as a freelancer, and client relations. Keeping freelancer topics in a separate workshop allows WordCamp Miami&#8217;s business track (held on Sunday, February 21st), to be more focused towards businesses and less on individual freelancers.</p>
<h3>WordPress Users: The Next Generation</h3>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kids-blogging-feature.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23102"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kids-blogging-feature.jpg?resize=1025%2C490" alt="kids-blogging-feature" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23102" /></a></p>
<p>WordCamp Miami will be hosting its first kids&#8217; panel, ‚ÄúThe Next Generation of WordPress Users,&#8221; on Sunday, February 21st. Organizers are actively looking for children under 18 who use WordPress and/or those who blog on other platforms. The panel will showcase how young people are using WordPress, what they think about blogging, and what other technologies they are using for publishing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMiami has always been youth-friendly but we thought a panel would be a good way to bring more young ones into the weekend schedule so that WordPress developers and leaders get to hear the childrens&#8217; viewpoints and thoughts &#8211; what tools they are using &#8211; why they are using them, etc,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;The newest generation will soon be the ones creating the new WordPress themes or plugins (or perhaps building something totally unique). I think their viewpoints are just as important as those who might be looking for that next great JavaScript app powered by WordPress.‚Äù</p>
<p>The 2016 edition of WordCamp Miami will have something for everyone, from beginners to more advanced WordPress users, with its schedule of unique tracks and workshops. This event has sold out every year, so if you intend to go you&#8217;ll want to <a href="http://2016.miami.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">grab your ticket</a> soon.</p>

If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">the WordPress plugins directory</a>.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1897/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1897/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&blog=116920&post=1897&subd=akismet&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 04 Jan 2016 23:29:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Christopher Finke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>On December 9th, 2015, WP Engine sent out an urgent notice to its customers regarding a <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-security-breach-customer-credentials-exposed" target="_blank">security breach wherein customer credentials were exposed</a>. This incident prompted an investigation, which is now complete.</p>
<p>According to the most recent and <a href="https://wpengine.com/support/infosec/" target="_blank">final update</a>, investigators determined that the security exposure came through one of the host&#8217;s cloud infrastructure providers. Customer credentials were exposed on December 4th and detected by WP Engine on December 9th. At that point customers were notified, the investigation was launched, and customer credentials were reset as a security precaution.</p>
<p>&#8220;WP Engine was attacked by an external criminal whose point of entry came through one of our cloud infrastructure providers,&#8221; founder and CTO Jason Cohen told the Tavern.</p>
<p>&#8220;An investigation by our own security team and independent security experts revealed the attacker bypassed multiple layers of authentication and gained unauthorized access to an administrative panel provided by this infrastructure provider. The criminal&#8217;s behavior in this exposure matches a pattern seen in other attacks throughout 2015,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When news of the breach was first published customers expressed frustration about the host‚Äôs lack of two-factor authentication. However, Cohen said that 2FA would not have made an impact for those affected by the recent security breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the point of entry wasn&#8217;t one of our systems, 2FA would not have prevented this event,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That said, 2FA is a best-practice, and so we do have plans to roll out 2FA in our User Portal in early 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also recommend that our customers enable 2FA for their WordPress site using one of the following recommended plugins: Google Authenticator or Clef, or use an external authentication system such as Google OAuth,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>
<p>WP Engine contacted the companies that were directly impacted by the attacker and implemented a plan to ensure their security. The independent investigation is now complete, but WP Engine continues to work with law enforcement authorities who are conducting a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>Peter Suhm, creator of <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a>, just released a new free video course for WordPress developers. After the success of his email-based <a href="https://wppusher.com/wordpress-git-crash-course" target="_blank">WP Git Crash Course</a>, Suhm jumped head-first into creating more educational material in video format. <a href="https://git4wp.com/" target="_blank">Git4wp.com</a> launched this week with more than 1.5 hours of recorded lessons, split up into 35 videos.</p>
<p>The new course offers a comprehensive look at commands, workflows, and anything a WordPress developer would need to know about using GitHub. Suhm&#8217;s teaser for the course is a 5-minute screencast demonstrating how to contribute to an open source WordPress plugin on GitHub.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>
<p>More Git-proficient WordPress developers means more potential customers for Suhm&#8217;s WP Pusher product, which allows you to deploy WordPress themes and plugins from GitHub.</p>
<p>&#8220;The videos are a great way for me to educate developers who might be interested in WP Pusher, so we can be more on the same page,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of jargon in the world of Git.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the new video format, he opted to take a beginner-friendly approach with bite-sized tutorials for all skill levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;The email course I made last summer was very well received and the number one piece of feedback was to create a similar thing in video format,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The email course was very much chronological, mostly showing my own workflow. With the videos I wanted to make something that was more for everyone &#8211; from beginners to developers already using Git. I think there will be a video for everyone, even more advanced Git users.&#8221;</p>
<p>The course begins with videos explaining what Git is and why you might want to use it, the difference between Git and Subversion, and covers the most commonly-used Git commands. The following videos include a breakdown of more advanced commands like <code>git bisect</code> and <code>git rebase</code>.</p>
<p>With more WordPress-related projects moving to GitHub, Suhm thought that it was a good time to create a video resource to help developers get on board. He underestimated the effort it would require until after he had already jumped headlong into creating <a href="https://git4wp.com" target="_blank">Git4wp.com</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, when I started recording the videos, I didn&#8217;t realize the amount of work I was in for,&#8221; Suhm told the Tavern. &#8220;Since I&#8217;ve been using Git professionally on a daily basis for a good amount of time, I thought I could just hit record and start talking. Recording and especially editing the videos ended up taking way more time than I thought initially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Screencasts are something I&#8217;ve wanted to try for a while. I&#8217;m not a native English speaker, so it&#8217;s also been a personal challenge releasing the videos,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Suhm plans to keep updating the videos and will add more as time permits. He is committed to keeping the course free as an educational resource for WordPress developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to make money from the videos, since they are in a sense subsidized by my product WP Pusher,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s much like when a company contributes to open source, which they can only afford if they have income coming from somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last set of videos include an overview of how to contribute to GitHub-hosted open source projects as well as tips for incorporating WP Pusher into your workflow. <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> is 100% free for open source projects that are hosted in a public repository, so students of the course can easily follow along and practice with their own projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://appstudio.windows.com/">Windows App Studio</a> is a template-driven, drag-and-drop software development tool that enables developers to publish Windows applications.</p>
<p>The new data source enables developers to easily connect Windows Applications to WordPress sites.

This feature is known as &#8220;Shiny Updates&#8221;. I&#8217;m a big fan of this feature because it&#8217;s substantially quicker than updating plugins via the updates page. Here&#8217;s what it looks like in action.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NewPluginUpdateRoutine.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-41064"><img class="size-full wp-image-41064" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NewPluginUpdateRoutine.gif?resize=837%2C688" alt="New Plugin Update Routine" /></a>New Plugin Update Routine
<p>Due to complications near the end of the 4.2 development cycle, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31529">shiny updates for themes</a> was pushed back to a later release. Since WordPress 4.3 and 4.4 didn&#8217;t add shiny update support for themes, I reached out to <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/obenland">Konstantin Obenland</a>, WordPress core developer, to find out its progress.</p>
<h2>Experimental Plugin</h2>
<p>The feature is currently on hold as the development team figures out the best way to implement it. The team is experimenting with different approaches <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates">using a feature plugin</a>. When installed, updates can be quickly applied from a theme&#8217;s detailed information panel by clicking the update now link.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ExperimentalThemeShinyUpdates.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50116"><img class="size-full wp-image-50116" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ExperimentalThemeShinyUpdates.png?resize=474%2C236" alt="Shiny Update Support Added" /></a>Shiny Update Support Added
<p>Not a lot of people know about the plugin because it was created around the time of WordCamp US. &#8220;Most of the things that are in the plugin are just quick ideas, a first iteration to get us going. We haven‚Äôt performed any user testing nor have we had a proper design iteration yet,&#8221; Obenland told the Tavern.</p>
<h2>My Experience With Shiny Theme Updates</h2>
<p>When I&#8217;m browsing themes that I&#8217;ve installed on my site, they&#8217;re displayed in a card format. When a theme has an update available, the update text displays at the top of the card. I tried to click on the text thinking it would update the theme but instead, it opened the theme&#8217;s details panel.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ThemeCardUpdateNotification.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50117"><img class="size-full wp-image-50117" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ThemeCardUpdateNotification.png?resize=384%2C307" alt="Theme Card Update Notification " /></a>Theme Card Update Notification
<p>In the same way I can update plugins on the plugins page, I should be able to update themes on the themes page. Having the shiny update link in the details pane requires an unnecessary mouse click. There are at least two challenges to overcome. The first is rewording the Update Available text to something that serves as both a notification and a link to initiate the update. The second is determining whether it&#8217;s an improved user experience.</p>
<h2>Why Shiny Updates Are so Fast</h2>
<p>Since shiny updates were added for plugins, I&#8217;ve been curious as to why they&#8217;re so much quicker than the normal update process. According to Oblenland, shiny updates are quicker because, &#8220;We don‚Äôt need to reload the entire admin page, twice if you include navigating back to the plugin screen. We only send the update request itself and receive the result of that. So instead of 85 requests over two page loads when deleting a plugin, we only have one,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>How You Can Get Involved</h2>
<p>Although the development team is not sure which direction they&#8217;ll go with shiny updates, Obenland says they want to use it to unite various actions in WordPress, &#8220;We want to unify the flows of installing/updating/activating/deleting plugins/themes/core with it and ultimately be able to get rid of the bleak screen of sadness that users currently see when performing these actions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Shiny updates is a feature plugin not tied to a specific trac ticket. If you want to keep up with development, you can <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates">follow the project</a> on GitHub.¬† You can also follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">discussions on Slack</a> in the <strong>#feature-shinyupdates</strong> channel. Obenland notes that the team is looking for more people who want to help develop, test the plugin, and share feedback at their weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 1900 UTC.</p>

<p>On December 17, telecommunications companies <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/brazil-whatsapp-ban-idINKBN0U00CT20151217" target="_blank">cut off access to WhatsApp in Brazil</a> after the company did not comply with police wiretapping requests. Many of the app&#8217;s estimated 100 million users went in search of an alternative, landing on <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, WhatsApp&#8217;s rival messaging app. Telegram  <a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/677604437905580032" target="_blank">gained 5.7 million new users</a> in one day as a result of the 48-hr blackout.</p>
<p>Incidents like this offer Telegram an opportunity to chip away at WhatsApp&#8217;s dominant marketshare. As of May 2015, the app reported <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/13/telegram-says-its-hit-62-maus-and-messaging-activity-has-doubled/?ncid=rss" target="_blank">62 million monthly active users</a>. If you are looking to prioritize and increase mobile traffic on your blog, this is one service you can&#8217;t afford to ignore.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/telegram-sharing-button-for-jetpack/" target="_blank">Telegram Sharing Button for Jetpack</a> is a plugin that gives mobile readers the ability to send content from your site to Telegram users on any platform, including Android, iPhone, Windows, and desktop clients for Mac, PC, and Linux. The plugin was created by Brazilian WordPress developer <a href="http://valeriosouza.com.br/" target="_blank">Valerio Souza</a>, who is also the the author of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-a-whatsapp-button-to-jetpacks-sharing-module" target="_blank">WhatsApp Sharing Button for Jetpack</a>.</p>
<p>After activating the plugin, if you&#8217;re already using Jetpack&#8217;s sharing module, you can visit the settings page to drag the Telegram icon into the enabled services section. The new Telegram sharing button will not appear on the desktop version of your site. You will need to test it by visiting a post from a mobile device.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/telegram-sharing.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50086"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/telegram-sharing.png?resize=1025%2C515" alt="telegram-sharing" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50086" /></a></p>
<p>The only complaint I have is that the white circle around the icon makes it look somewhat out of place among the other icons that share a simpler design. The icon&#8217;s resolution also needs to be improved for retina displays. Other than that, everything looks and works as advertised when sharing a post to Telegram.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t recently taken inventory of your Jetpack sharing buttons, you may want to review your most popular content to see what services readers are using to share your posts. Depending on the demographics of your site&#8217;s visitors, both the WhatsApp and Telegram sharing buttons may be more beneficial than the &#8220;Email,&#8221; &#8220;Google+,&#8221; or &#8220;Print&#8221; buttons, for example. These could be hidden behind the share button. As groups and channels become more common on mobile messaging apps, prominently displaying sharing buttons for these services may help your posts travel faster and further than any kind of search engine optimization.</p>
<p>Both the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/telegram-sharing-button-for-jetpack/" target="_blank">Telegram</a> and <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-a-whatsapp-button-to-jetpacks-sharing-module" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a> Sharing buttons for Jetpack can be downloaded for free from the WordPress.org plugin directory.</p>

<p>Automattic <a href="https://wordads.co/2015/12/28/adcontrol-plugin-is-here/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that its <a href="https://wordads.co/" target="_blank">WordAds</a> advertising network is now available to self-hosted WordPress sites via Jetpack and the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/radcontrol/" target="_blank">AdControl</a> plugin. WordAds, which bears a name confusingly similar to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.google.com/adwords/" target="_blank">AdWords</a>, delivers all the advertising seen on WordPress.com&#8217;s free sites. (Ad display on VIP or upgraded sites is opt-in.)</p>
<p>Self-hosted WordPress site owners who want to earn money with WordAds must first <a href="https://wordads.co/signup/" target="_blank">apply</a> to join the network and are required to meet a minimum traffic requirement. Automattic doesn&#8217;t publish the exact minimum necessary for eligibility but the <a href="https://wordads.co/faq/" target="_blank">WordAds FAQ</a> page says &#8220;a site generally needs thousands of page views each month.&#8221; The site will also need to have both Jetpack and the AdControl plugin installed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on the plugin off and on (mostly off) since mid 2014,&#8221; said Derek Springer, a Code Wrangler at Automattic who helped write the AdControl plugin. &#8220;We took a big pause to completely re-work the back end (WordAds 2.0) which is what we are now using all over WordPress.com.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://wordads.co/2015/11/02/introducing-wordads-2-0/" target="_blank">WordAds 2.0</a>, unveiled in November 2015, integrated WordAds into WordPress.com‚Äôs main Settings interface with earnings reports and payout information. It also introduced a real time bidding environment where ad agencies and buyers can bid on global ad impressions.</p>
<p>In 2013, Automattic paid out around $1 million to WordAds publishers whose sites delivered 1 billion ad impressions per month. Published numbers are not yet available for 2015, but WordAds 2.0 has increased interest in the program, according to the <a href="https://wordads.co/2015/12/28/adcontrol-plugin-is-here/" target="_blank">announcement</a> today. With the release of AdControl for self-hosted sites, the number of publishers available on the network has the potential to increase significantly.</p>
<h3>Why Does AdControl Require Jetpack?</h3>
<p>For years, the WordPress community has been <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share" target="_blank">waiting to see how Automattic will monetize Jetpack</a>. In addition to giving self-hosted users access to many of WordPress.com&#8217;s features, Jetpack now serves as a gateway to Automattic&#8217;s advertising network for more than 1 million active installs.</p>
<p>I asked Springer why AdControl requires Jetpack and he cited the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need the site‚Äôs unique ID (assigned to each Jetpack site) to track ad impressions in the back-end.</li>
<li>We piggyback on Jetpack‚Äôs REST API connection to access some authenticated endpoints in the WP.com API.</li>
<li>The payout/earning settings are all controlled via Calypso and we want a singular, unified experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>WordAds is deeply tied into WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure and as such requires authentication for tracking and rewarding participating sites. Jetpack provides the connecting link and is now key to opening up the world of independently-hosted WordPress blogs to Automattic&#8217;s advertising network.</p>

<p>Most of the themes created by the professional design team at WordPress.com are geared towards bloggers. Business themes make up a much smaller segment of those designed in-house. That&#8217;s why the latest <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes/pique" target="_blank">Pique</a> theme is an unusual and exciting release.</p>
<p>Although the theme was originally designed for coffee shops, it also works well for other small businesses like caf√©s, bakeries, hair salons, and shops. Pique can be instantly branded for any business by uploading a logo and a custom header.</p>
<p>Its unique scrolling front page is created by adding panel sections, which are actually standard pages with content and featured images. Pique includes eight optional panels, which can be assigned within the customizer. Each panel control includes a dropdown selection of pages for the panel content, a background color option, and the ability to adjust the featured image&#8217;s opacity.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pique-front-page.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50044"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pique-front-page.png?resize=1025%2C2032" alt="pique-front-page" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50044" /></a></p>
<p>Single posts have an optional sidebar and the footer also includes three widget areas. Pique supports different page designs via three unique templates: full-width, grid, and testimonials. A grid style page needs to be set as a parent page and individual items will show up if they are set as child pages. The featured image of the child page displays as an image in the grid. It&#8217;s a somewhat convoluted process that&#8217;s not terribly intuitive, but it works.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/grid-template.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50047"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/grid-template.png?resize=660%2C343" alt="grid-template" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50047" /></a></p>
<p>Testimonials and recent blog posts can be displayed within the panels following instructions in the theme&#8217;s documentation. All testimonial content can also be viewed via its dedicated archive page at /testimonial/.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/testimonial-template.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50049"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/testimonial-template.png?resize=660%2C264" alt="testimonial-template" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50049" /></a></p>
<p>Pique has the capacity for special formatting using icons from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>. Call-to-action buttons and panel overlay text can be added using short HTML snippets from the theme&#8217;s instructions.</p>
<p>Pique makes it easy for anyone to build a one-page, branded website with all the specialized content sections that you would traditionally expect from a business theme. It has not yet arrived on WordPress.org but self-hosted uses can download the theme as a zip file from its <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes/pique" target="_blank">homepage on WordPress.com</a>.</p>

After installing <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-woocommerce-brands/">Ultimate WooCommerce Brands</a> developed by <a href="http://magniumthemes.com/">MagniumThemes</a>, a large admin notice appears with an affiliate linked display banner for Bluehost.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BluehostBannerInsidePlugin.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50021"><img class="size-full wp-image-50021" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BluehostBannerInsidePlugin.png?resize=815%2C363" alt="Bluehost Banner Admin Notice" /></a>Bluehost Banner Admin Notice
<p>Ultimate WooCommerce Brands is a freemium plugin and while I&#8217;m not against plugin authors making a few bucks through advertising, displaying a webhosting banner seems irrelevant.</p>
<p>The advertising banner also shows up on every admin page in the WordPress backend which I feel abuses the admin notice function, even though there&#8217;s a &#8220;Hide This Message button&#8221;. Upsells and advertising should be confined to the plugin&#8217;s activation and settings pages according to number 11 of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">WordPress plugin directory guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plugins should not hijack the blog admin. It is fine to include an Upgrade prompt on the plugin admin page, but not throughout the blog. It is acceptable to embed a widget on the dashboard but this should be the same size as others and be dismissable. It&#8217;s fine to put an error message at the top of the admin for special cases, but it should be linked to a way to fix the error and it should be infrequent. Any form of &#8220;nagging&#8221; is absolutely prohibited.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood, a member of the group and plugin review team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1059920750736805/?comment_id=1062714040457476&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D">confirmed</a> that plugins that display advertising on every admin page violate the guidelines and users should report them by emailing <strong>plugins at wordpress.org. </strong></p>
<h2>The Guidelines Provide Wiggle Room</h2>
<p>The plugin review team polices content in plugins, prevents spam, and attempts at bad faith from entering the directory. They also advise authors when they feel something that the plugin does is a bad idea. It&#8217;s important to note that <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">the guidelines</a> are not black and white. Instead, they&#8217;re somewhat subjective which allows the team to make decisions on a case by case basis.</p>
<h2>The Power of Reviews</h2>
<p>The WordPress plugin directory gives users an opportunity to provide feedback directly to plugin developers and users through reviews. Reviews are an excellent way to tell the developer why you dislike or like a plugin and it also gives fellow users in the community a heads up.</p>
<p>So far, no one has mentioned the display advertising in <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/ultimate-woocommerce-brands">their reviews</a> of Ultimate WooCommerce Brands. Perhaps it&#8217;s not an issue or users have chosen to disable it and move on to a different option. One of the benefits of WordPress is that there&#8217;s usually more than one plugin available to accomplish a task.</p>
<p>Jan Dembowksi, a volunteer moderator for the WordPress.org support forums, explains another benefits to reviewing plugins &#8220;Some of the forum moderators read <em>every</em> review. Occasionally, there may be a pattern if there‚Äôs a complaint such as not being able to dismiss the upsell banner or taking over the dashboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes that leads to the moderator installing the plugin or theme on a test installation. This is to see if there‚Äôs really a problem or not. If there‚Äôs a valid concern then it gets reported up. It doesn‚Äôt happen often thankfully, but it has occurred and the plugin or theme author got a polite shoulder tap,&#8221; Dembowski told the Tavern.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Your Breaking Point?</h2>
<p>We know that upsells and display advertising are allowed in plugins as long as they follow the directory guidelines. How a plugin&#8217;s settings pages are displayed is up to the developer, but, as a user, how much advertising or upselling is too much? What&#8217;s your advertising limit inside a freemium plugin before you purchase the pro version or move on to an alternative?</p>

The folks at 10up have open sourced <a href="https://github.com/10up/flexibility" target="_blank">Flexibility</a>, a polyfill that uses JavaScript to allow Flexbox to work with IE  versions 8 and 9.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/flexibility.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49998"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/flexibility.png?resize=1025%2C386" alt="flexibility" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49998" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, Flexbox support wasn‚Äôt added to Internet Explorer until version 10, leaving older versions ‚Äì still popular in some corners ‚Äì out of the Flexbox revolution,&#8221; said Taylor Lovett, 10up&#8217;s Director of Web Engineering. &#8220;This idea didn‚Äôt sit well with 10up‚Äôer Jonathan Neal, tasked with engineering a beautiful layout for a Fortune 50 forced to contend with supporting older versions. We decided to subsidize his time to see if we could introduce Flexbox support under less-than-ideal browser requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>CSS Tricks has a comprehensive <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">guide to to Flexbox</a>, a layout it recommends as more appropriate for components of an application or smaller-scale sites, (as an alternative to the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank">Grid</a> for large-scale layouts).</p>
<p>The idea behind Flexbox, according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/" target="_blank">w3.org docs</a>, is to provide a flexible container that expands or shrinks based on available layout space:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can ‚Äúflex‚Äù their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flexbox is ideal for creating layouts that work with various screen sizes and devices, especially in cases where the layout&#8217;s container size is unknown or dynamic. Flexibility extends this to IE 8 and 9 by tapping into the browser&#8217;s <code><a href="http://help.dottoro.com/ljqkvomc.php" target="_blank">currentStyle</a></code> and <code><a href="http://help.dottoro.com/ljhddfwr.php" target="_blank">runtimeStyle</a></code> proprietary features to manipulate and overwrite style declarations.</p>
<p>Once you include flexibility.js somewhere within your project, it will automatically detect Flexbox elements and write new styles to make them work with IE 8 and 9. Flexibility is licensed under the GPL v2 (or later). Check out the <a href="https://github.com/10up/flexibility" target="_blank">repo on GitHub</a> to get more details on how to use it and how it works.</p>

<p>At a time where large websites such as <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/removing-blog-comments/">Copyblogger</a> and the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/2015/12/16/toronto-star-closing-commenting-on-thestarcom.html">Toronto Star</a> are closing down comments in favor of social media, the Tavern continues to be a source of open conversation about WordPress. However, 2015 has been a tough year as a moderator.</p>
<h2>A Year of Firsts</h2>
<p>For the first time in years, I created a <a href="http://wptavern.com/comment-policy">comment moderation policy</a> to establish a baseline of expectations for moderators and commenters. Also for the first time in the site&#8217;s history, I banned an individual from leaving comments on the Tavern.</p>
<p>In the Tavern&#8217;s early days, I looked forward to discussing things with people via the comments and did everything I could to encourage them. Some of the conversations over the years have been great and have led to positive changes in WordPress. Six years later, many of the comments on the Tavern appear to be filled with anger, mostly from the same people. Dealing with so much negativity all the time makes comment moderation difficult.</p>
<h2>Taking a More Active Role in Discussions</h2>
<p>One of my New Years resolutions for 2016 is to take a more active role in the discussions on the Tavern. I want to reestablish the feeling the Tavern had a few years ago where everyone is welcome to share their opinions as long as its done in a respectful way.</p>
<p>Comments are a great way to share feedback, ideas, opinions, and look at things from a different perspective. But when the conversation turns into a mud-slinging contest which has recently happened too often on the Tavern, it turns into a pile of meaningless words.</p>
<h2>Commenting Goals for 2016</h2>
<p>In 2016, let&#8217;s try to having meaningful conversations where words transition into action. Let&#8217;s discuss ideas, opinions, and perspectives without getting or taking things personal. Let&#8217;s encourage collaboration instead of infighting. Let&#8217;s assume the best in someone&#8217;s words instead of the worst. In the New Year, I&#8217;ll do my best to try to lead conversations in these directions but I need commenters to do their part as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s commented on the Tavern over the years. Your feedback is and continues to be a valuable asset to this site.

Kashif organizes the local Lahore meetup, which started with a few dozen attendees three months ago and grew to more than 500 this past weekend. His team has been working hard to bring WordCamp to Pakistan, and today their application was approved by the WordPress Foundation.</p>
<p>The event will officially be called WordCamp Lahore. Kashif said that they originally proposed &#8220;WordCamp Pakistan&#8221; but were asked to keep it local to the city. The Foundation&#8217;s reply to their request was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We stay away from labeling WordCamps with the country name rather than the city, because we have found that doing so discourages local organizers from doing additional WordCamps in the country. We had some problems with this in the past, where because there was a &#8220;national&#8221; WordCamp, no other WordCamps ever happened in that country. When we changed the naming convention to be city-focused, that country developed stronger local communities and several WordCamps per year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The application proposed September for the event but the dates have not yet been finalized. WordCamp Lahore organizers will have an orientation meeting with WP Foundation representatives tomorrow to begin the planning process.</p>
<p>Kashif told the Tavern that they are looking at the <a href="http://www.expolahore.com/" target="_blank">Lahore International Expo Centre</a> as a possible venue, since it has an 820 seat capacity. The team will be meeting with a few different venue providers to find a good fit.</p>

<p>As Pakistan is a multilingual country, most of the Lahore meetup sessions are conducted in English. This means that the WordCamp will likely be accessible to a wide range of people outside of Pakistan as well. If the Lahore meetup attendance numbers are any indication, the first WordCamp in Pakistan has the potential to be one of the largest first WordCamps in history.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailbag/" target="_blank">Mailbag</a> is not a new plugin but it&#8217;s one of those convenient tools you&#8217;ll want to bookmark if you build WordPress sites that require email subscription forms. The plugin makes it easy to add a MailChimp or Campaign Monitor email form to posts or pages using a shortcode.</p>
<p>I only recently came across it while <a href="http://wptavern.com/politics-a-free-wordpress-theme-for-political-campaigns" target="_blank">reviewing the Politics theme</a>, which prominently features an email signup form powered by Mailbag.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/politics-screenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49589"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/politics-screenshot.png?resize=705%2C460" alt="politics-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49589" /></a></p>
<p>If you have your Mailchimp or Campaign Monitor API key handy, then you can add your email subscription form in under a minute. Paste in the key, select your list, and customize your button text. (Your API keys must be saved before you can select a list to add subscribers.) Once these settings are saved, you can place the shortcode anywhere within your content.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mailbag-settings.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49929"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mailbag-settings.png?resize=1025%2C889" alt="mailbag-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49929" /></a></p>
<p>The flexibility for styling the forms is what sets this plugin apart. You can opt to use the built-in minimal Mailbag styling or allow your theme to dictate the style. If you choose to disable the default style, the usage tab on the plugin&#8217;s settings page outlines the CSS classes you will want to customize.</p>
<pre class="brush: css; light: true; title: ; notranslate">
.mailbag-wrap { /* Wraps entire form */ }

.mailbag-wrap label { /* Label styles */ }

.mailbag-wrap input[type="text"] { /* Name and email input styles */ }

.mailbag-wrap input[type="submit"] { /* Submit button styles */ }
</pre>
<p>Mailbag was created by the folks at <a href="https://arraythemes.com/" target="_blank">Array</a> for use with <a href="https://arraythemes.com/themes/transmit-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">Transmit</a>, a landing page theme that features an email subscription form. Array built it to be compatible with any theme (not just their own) and made the plugin freely available on WordPress.org</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/transmit-mailbag.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-49933"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/transmit-mailbag.jpg?resize=984%2C783" alt="transmit-mailbag" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49933" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a theme developer and your theme requires an email subscription form, there&#8217;s no need to reinvent the wheel or bloat your theme with extra functionality. It&#8217;s much easier to select professionally supported plugins from WordPress.org and present the user with plugin recommendations using a tool like <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/" target="_blank">TGM Plugin Activation</a>. You can design around your recommended plugins without having to support and maintain them.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailbag/" target="_blank">Mailbag</a> is easy for users to configure, publicly distributed on WordPress.org, and doesn&#8217;t take a heavy hand to styling. If you want a solid, simple plugin to use and recommend, this is a handy one to tuck into your toolbag.</p>

<p>Contributors to the WordPress core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/customize/" target="_blank">Customize component</a> are targeting the upcoming 4.5 release for inclusion of a new feature plugin. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-pane-resizer/" target="_blank">Customize Pane Resizer</a> allows users to drag the edge of the pane to make the customizer wider than the default 300px.</p>
<p>According to Customize component maintainer <a href="https://weston.ruter.net/" target="_blank">Weston Ruter</a>, the idea for the plugin came out of the community summit held earlier this month in Philadelphia, where it was raised as a usability improvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Justin Sternberg took ownership of the idea and we collaborated on it over the course of the community summit and WCUS,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;He did all the real work, and I just contributed ideas and provided Customizer architectural pointers.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the moment, the pane simply resizes when the user drags the resize icon, but even this one feature involves refining many tiny details. Ruter said the immediate roadmap for the plugin is to resolve the <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-pane-resizer/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issues</a> that have already been logged.</p>
<h3>Future Possibility of Undocking the Customizer and Adding Inline Controls</h3>
<p>Contributors have many other ideas for extending this feature, including the possibility of introducing positioning options (ie. right/left/bottom). These ideas are in the discussion phase and are not set in stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to being able to move the pane to the right (or to the top/bottom, which are technically problematic), Justin had the idea of allowing the pane to be dragged anywhere on the screen,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this way the Customizer pane would work like panels in PhotoShop which can be docked into the sidebar or they can be dragged out to float freely. This would allow the Customizer to be positioned anywhere on the screen, with a full page preview in background.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside the idea of the customizer pane becoming a floating window, contributors are also <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32296" target="_blank">discussing</a> applying this same concept to individual customizer controls. This ties into one of the items on Ruter&#8217;s <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/23/outlining-a-possible-roadmap-for-the-customizer/" target="_blank">longer-term roadmap for the Customizer</a> &#8211; inline controls:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äã<strong>Bootstrapped Customizer</strong>:‚Äã Lazy-load the Customizer into the current frontend view without having to leave the page. With selective refresh implemented, inline controls and frontend bootstrapping would be possible since full-page refreshes would no longer be required.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Instead of all of the controls being docked into the one pane and organized into panels and sections, they could instead (or in addition) be displayed alongside the elements in the preview that they modify,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;For example, editing a widget could pop open a floating widget form control next to the widget in the preview.&#8221;</p>
<p>These alternative UI considerations are currently beyond the scope of the Customize Pane Resizer feature plugin, which Ruter said will be limited to polishing up the resizing feature for 4.5.</p>
<h3>The Customize Pane Resizer Addresses Important Usability Concerns</h3>
<p>When <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-officially-proposed-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">menus were added to the customizer in WordPress 4.3</a>, many thought that the narrow width of the pane created a cramped menu management experience. The ability to resize the customizer pane addresses this concern by allowing users to expand it for tasks that require more real estate.</p>
<p>Ruter doesn&#8217;t anticipate many objections to merging the Customize Pane Resizer plugin, given that it solves several usability problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it is very controversial,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It seems a major complaint I hear often about the Customizer is that it doesn&#8217;t give the user enough room, so this would allow the user to have as much room as they want.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another concern I&#8217;ve heard is that people don&#8217;t know the pane can be collapsed at all (even though there is a collapse button on the bottom), so this greatly improves the visibility of collapsing and it implements a common UI paradigm where panes can be resized by dragging on their edge (e.g. Chrome dev tools),&#8221; Ruter said.</p>
<p>In making the pane resizable, Ruter&#8217;s chief concern is ensuring that the controls will respond nicely to varying widths, including those created by plugins. Expanding the customizer pane with the resizer plugin currently stretches the controls somewhat awkwardly and in some cases leaves a lot of empty real estate.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/customize-pane-expanded.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49918"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/customize-pane-expanded.png?resize=1025%2C396" alt="customize-pane-expanded" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49918" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest concern I have is that controls are designed for the 300px width, generally,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;So if the width is all of a sudden 900px, then the (custom) controls may well not look right.</p>
<p>&#8220;The controls in Core need to be updated to ensure they work in a variable-width pane. But plugin controls would need to do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you want to help contribute to the Customizer Pane Resizer&#8217;s development, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-pane-resizer" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>. It is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-pane-resizer/" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a> but the GitHub version is always more up-to-date. If you have developed a plugin or theme that extends the customizer, you may want to test the resizer and offer feedback/code improvements on GitHub. Anyone interested can join the conversation in the #core-customize channel on WordPress Slack.</p>

After accumulating more than 170 plugins in five months, Gliebe decided to <a href="http://wptavern.com/pro-plugin-directory-is-seeking-a-new-owner">sell the site</a> in November citing a lack of time to devote to the project.</p>
<p>Charlie Livingston, founder of <a href="http://athemes.com/">aThemes</a>, is the new owner of <a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/pro-plugin-directory-has-a-new-owner/">Pro Plugin Directory</a>. Livingston purchased the site because he believes in its potential. Gliebe received more than 20 offers to acquire the site but after the first one fell through, he chose Livingston&#8217;s offer.

<p>Pro Plugin Directory will remain the same in the short-term as Livingston learns how the site works. However, he plans to add new features in addition to increasing marketing efforts, &#8220;I have a few ideas about what I can do to make PPD an even better resource as the aim is to make it the go-to place for commercial plugins,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Livingston is currently soliciting feedback on what features and enhancements you&#8217;d like to see made to the directory. Pro Plugin Directory is one of the few resources devoted to listing commercial WordPress plugins so it&#8217;s great to see the directory will live on with someone willing to spend the time and effort needed to maintain the site.</p>

It is one of the most bare bones blogging themes to hit WordPress.org in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Throughout 2015, the single-column, centered layout has been a mainstay of WordPress theme designs that cater to active bloggers. Reyl Lite is a perfect example of this, with its homepage stripped down to post titles, excerpts, and minimal post meta. No featured images are required to make this design work.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/reyl-lite.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49872"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/reyl-lite.png?resize=1025%2C769" alt="reyl-lite" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49872" /></a></p>
<p>Single posts feature a large title, colorful tags and categories, with previous/next post title navigation beneath the content.</p>
<p>The theme includes customizer options that allow you to select a header image, background image/color, and header text color. If you want the design that is shown in the <a href="http://demo.quemalabs.com/reyl-lite/" target="_blank">live demo</a>, you actually don&#8217;t have to touch any of the options.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/reyl-single-post-screenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49886"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/reyl-single-post-screenshot.png?resize=1025%2C712" alt="reyl-single-post-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49886" /></a></p>
<p>Reyl Lite does not include any widget areas, which creates a clutter-free display. This could be a deal breaker for those who need more customization options.</p>
<p>CSS animations are a nice touch, but one thing the theme is lacking is a default set of strong typography selections. That attention to detail would have put Reyl Lite into a more elegant category. Without this, the content falls a little flat. Fortunately, that can be easily remedied with the addition of a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=google+fonts" target="_blank">Google Fonts plugin</a> or a few modifications to a child theme.</p>
<p>One odd quirk of this theme is that the first break point is right at 1280&#215;1024 screen resolution, which is where you will see the mobile view. Other than that, it responds very well to different devices.</p>
<p>The theme was created by the folks at <a href="https://www.quemalabs.com/" target="_blank">Quema Labs</a>. The company has <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/author/nicoandrade/" target="_blank">several other free themes</a> on WordPress.org designed in a similar style. Reyl Lite&#8217;s straightforward layout and sparing use of colored links could lend charm to content-focused blogs that don&#8217;t require support for a lot of extra fluff. You can <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/reyl-lite/" target="_blank">download</a> it for free from WordPress.org.</p>

<p>If this sounds too difficult, consider using the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/restore-lost-functionality/">Restore Lost Functionality</a> plugin developed by, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/codedart/">Coded Art</a>. As the name suggests, the plugin restores functionality removed or hidden from view. In its current state, it has three options. The features it can restore varies depending on the version of WordPress you&#8217;re using.</p>

<p>I tested the plugin by restoring the title field when inserting links and discovered it works as expected. As WordPress evolves, Coded Art plans to continue restoring features for those that depend on them. If there&#8217;s a feature you&#8217;d like to see this plugin restore, let Coded Art know in the comments.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the WordPress community in Lahore, Pakistan held its third monthly meetup. The first meetup had just a few dozen attendees, the second approximately 300, and this weekend they had more than 500 WordPress professionals and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Attendee <a href="https://twitter.com/noumaan_" target="_blank">Noumaan Yaqoob</a> traveled from Karachi to the event and shared his experience in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/noumaan.yaqoob/posts/10153414598007695" target="_blank">post</a> on Facebook:</p>
<p>&#8220;The auditorium was full of young students, experts, freelancers,&#8221; Yaqoob said. &#8220;There were people sitting on stairs, standing at the entrance and the organizers had to quickly install a large screen outside so that people could sit outside too. The energy of these young people was mind blowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a chance to interact with lots of participants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were all excited about using WordPress in their professional lives and many of them already had small freelancing setups. I was very impressed by their passion for entrepreneurship and creating jobs not just for themselves but for others too.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kashif_mp" target="_blank">Muhammad Kashif</a>, one of the organizers for the Lahore meetup, said that news of the event spread through an extensive network of Pakistani freelancers who are connected by social media. ProPakistani, a local IT news site, also published an <a href="http://propakistani.pk/2015/12/14/wordpress-meetups-is-coming-to-lahore-on-19th/" target="_blank">article</a> that helped new attendees learn about the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to close registration two days before the event because we didn&#8217;t have space,&#8221; Kashif said. He and fellow organizers, with the help of 25 volunteers, printed directions, arranged refreshments, and managed the crowd. As the meetup is still very new, they put the event together without the help of any official sponsors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got a free venue from <a href="http://techhubconnect.pitb.gov.pk/" target="_blank">TechHub Connect</a>, the local co-working space provider,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;The rest we managed from our own pockets. We wish we had more resources, but we will continue to do our best to educate and inspire the local WordPress community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kashif hopes that the event will attract more sponsors but wants to be careful to preserve their purpose and focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome anyone who wants to join us but we would like to maintain the independence and the freedom of WordPress,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h3>Paving the Way for WordCamp Pakistan</h3>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lahore-wp-meetup-pakistan.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-49843"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lahore-wp-meetup-pakistan.jpg?resize=1025%2C547" alt="lahore-wp-meetup-pakistan" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49843" /></a></p>
<p>Organizers of the Lahore WordPress meetup expect even more attendees at the next event on January 16. They are working together with other active meetups in Karachi, Sialkot, and Hyderabad to organize WordCamp Pakistan as a mega event in September 2016. The WordPress Foundation is currently reviewing their application.</p>
<p>English and Urdu are the primary languages used by the WordPress community in Pakistan, so the WordCamp would be accessible to many more attendees from outside the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan is a very multilingual country,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;But English is the unofficial official language. So most of the sessions are in English but the speaker or presenter may switch to Urdu to make their presentation even more interesting. We actually don&#8217;t even notice when someone has switched from English to Urdu and vice versa,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>WordPress and other open source technologies open up a world of new employment opportunities to freelancers in developing nations like Pakistan. This has helped fuel the growth of the Lahore meetup, which is now largely made up of freelancers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The local economy is struggling, which is pushing young individuals to start their own businesses or improve their skills,&#8221; Kashif said.</p>
<p>&#8220;WordPress offers great employment opportunities as one can work from home and does not need a visa or immigration,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ease and familiarity with English helps Pakistani freelancers work easily with clients from all over the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although some Pakistani professionals work in well-known WordPress-related businesses as remote support, customer care, or developers, a larger number are freelancers who have formed small companies and are creating new jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan has a large user base of WordPress freelancers and developers,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;We feel it&#8217;s about time we put it on the map and tell the world about the huge potential we have here.&#8221;</p>

The site provides a WordPress hook/API reference for developers, but creator <a href="https://twitter.com/explodybits" target="_blank">Christopher Sanford</a> has a vision to do much more with it in 2016.</p>
<p>Today Sanford announced the release of the new <a href="http://hookr.io/plugin/" target="_blank">official Hookr plugin</a>, which is available for free. It displays the actions and filters that fired as the page loaded.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hookr-plugin.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49814"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hookr-plugin.png?resize=1025%2C701" alt="hookr-plugin" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49814" /></a></p>
<p>Hovering over the indicators and clicking through to a specific hook will show its details, including the tag, invoker, description, and value.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hook-details.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49815"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hook-details.png?resize=1025%2C701" alt="hook-details" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49815" /></a></p>
<p>The plugin also includes a built-in Lucene search engine for super fast filtering from the admin bar. Developers can tweak the default Hookr settings to ignore or watch hooks with wildcards. The plugin is easily configured under the Tools menu.</p>
<p>Sanford began working on the official Hookr plugin a week before WordCamp US.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would actually be useful&#8211; but I showed Zac and a few others and they seemed to like it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I pulled an 18-hour bender in Philly to get it nearly complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plugin has been beta tested for the past two weeks and is now stable and ready for use. As it&#8217;s geared purely for development, it should not be installed on a production site.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s Next for Hookr in 2016?</h3>
<p>During the past year Sanford has been steadily adding plugins at the request of users, including Pods, WP E-Commerce, Caldera Forms, and others. He hopes that commercial theme and plugin developers will get on board so that he can host their APIs as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done some substantial reworking to the parsing engine &#8211; it now tracks discrepancies between the source code and the documentation,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;This will be something that I will be offering as a service as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the short term (by the end odf Q1), I plan to keep refining the parsing engine, adding plugins, and working on features users actually care about,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be launching the API site that will be piloting around the same time. I will be working with the Rocket Genius (Gravity Forms) guys to provide realtime data for their premium plugin.&#8221;</p>
<p>After those initiatives are released, Sanford told the Tavern that he&#8217;s going to focus on creating native IDE plugins for Atom and Sublime.</p>
<h3>No Name Change Planned, Hookr Swag Store Coming Soon</h3>
<p>The Hookr name and branding has been controversial with a few who find it off-putting and offensive. Sanford considered changing the name but has now decided to keep the original brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market is flooded, it&#8217;s a short, memorable and established brand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On numerous occasions, individuals have used the term &#8216;unfortunate&#8217; to describe the name. If it&#8217;s so offensive, then why do my usage and followers keep increasing? The people complaining are not paying my bills, nor are they even relevant users of the resource. Simply put, their opinions mean nothing to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanford has wrestled with the name change and has even purchased numerous alternative domains but nothing felt right. He will soon be launching a swag line with tees, mugs, stickers, and any product that will help him to pay for hosting Hookr.io.</p>
<p>&#8220;At WCUS, I decided that either I could limp Hookr along, or I could make it undeniably a fixture in the WordPress ecosystem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I decided on the latter. And that is exactly what I&#8217;m doing with offerings such as the Hookr plugin.&#8221;</p>

Jacoby is the project lead for bbPress and BuddyPress. In the video interview below he offers a quick overview of what to expect in BuddyPress 2.5.</p>
<p>Jacoby also gives us a look inside his <a href="https://github.com/stuttter" target="_blank">Stuttter</a> project, which contains several social components, and explores how they might fit into WordPress. These include his experiments with users, profiles, and the user experience as it pertains to aggregating activity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really just attacking the idea of the big features of BuddyPress in a smaller way that developers can interact with more conveniently, such as taxonomies and metadata vs. the big monolithic solution that BuddyPress tends to be,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don‚Äôt think my experimentation with Stuttter is going to translate into me spending less time on BuddyPress,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;It‚Äôs like a side project. It‚Äôs like an artist switching from oil to watercolor paint. You try and see what‚Äôs over there and bring back in what you learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacoby said that he hopes to continue to provide leadership for BuddyPress for the foreseeable future. Part of this is mentoring BP core leadership to step up to feel comfortable leading and making decisions. The other part is helping the project navigate what he believes to be an identity crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;BuddyPress as a project has an identity crisis,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t know what exactly it&#8217;s supposed to be to the people who are using it. Defining what BuddyPress&#8217; identity is or what problems it&#8217;s truly trying to solve is what it needs. Until that happens it&#8217;s going to float along without a clear definition of what it&#8217;s trying to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of his efforts to help BuddyPress navigate this identity crisis, Jacoby has been talking to people and agencies who are actively using it. At the end of the interview he puts out a call for anyone who is using the software to reach out to him with feedback on where BuddyPress should go in the future.</p>

<p>When the WordPress theme review team announced it would <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options">require theme authors</a> to use the customizer to build theme options, many voiced <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options#comments">their displeasure</a> in the comments. Bruce Wampler, lead developer of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/weaver-xtreme/">Weaver Xtreme</a> WordPress theme, commented that his theme <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options#comment-67685">received a death sentence</a> due to the requirement.</p>
<p>Eight months later, Wampler has changed his tune and is now in favor of the customizer to display theme options to users, &#8220;I must admit that I was among the many objectors to this requirement. After all, my theme has over 600 options, and that is a lot of code conversion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://weavertheme.com/wordpress-customizer-supporting-600-theme-options/">case study published on the Weaver Xtreme website</a>, Wampler describes why he&#8217;s now a fan of the customizer and explains the process of migrating 600 options to it.</p>
<h2>Live Updates</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling reasons he adopted the customizer is experiencing the live preview feature, &#8220;It is the WYSIWYG design paradigm, especially with &#8216;live update&#8217; options, of the Customizer that have become totally compelling to me. Moving the mouse over the color selector and watching it change instantly on the site preview is just something you can‚Äôt give up once you‚Äôve seen it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Serious Performance Improvements</h2>
<p>During the migration process, Wampler discovered two serious speed issues. Since the customizer processing uses JavaScript, loading hundreds of options took 30 seconds or more depending on the user&#8217;s browser and CPU.</p>
<p>The second issue involved overriding original theme setting values versus new values. The customizer used a WordPress filter for each option. Unfortunately, the filters ran every time an option was configured creating an exponentially negative impact on performance. If 40 options were processed, it resulted in 1,600 executions of the filters.</p>
<p>Wampler worked with <a href="https://weston.ruter.net/">Weston Ruter</a>, lead developer of the customizer component, who <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32103">changed the algorithm</a> to allow multidimensional settings to be scalable. Once the change was made, Wampler was able to load his theme options in one to two seconds. The fix is included in WordPress 4.4 and will help other theme authors who have more than 20 options in the customizer.</p>
<h2>My Experience Using Weaver Xtreme</h2>
<p>I installed Weaver Xtreme on a test site running WordPress 4.5 alpha to see what it&#8217;s like using the customizer when it has 600+ options. It took 6-10 seconds to initially load the customizer. Subsequent loading takes the same amount of time.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WeaverExtremeCustomizer.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49796"><img class="size-full wp-image-49796" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WeaverExtremeCustomizer.png?resize=1025%2C502" alt="Weaver Xtreme's Customizer" /></a>Weaver Xtreme&#8217;s Customizer
<p>I expected to see a lot of panels expand horizontally into the theme&#8217;s design, but Weaver Xtreme only uses one panel to prevent that from happening. Limiting options to one panel helps to prevent feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Color changes happen instantaneously while other changes require the preview pane to refresh. Some of the refreshes take a few seconds to load. Overall, I found the experience to be better than configuring the theme from the WordPress backend using an options panel.</p>
<h2>The Customizer is a Great Way to Learn JavaScript Deeply</h2>
<p>The customizer is one of the newest components in WordPress. It uses object-oriented PHP and is primarily a JavaScript application. Ruter says it&#8217;s one of the best ways for theme authors to learn JavaScript deeply, &#8220;There is a lot to the customizer. It is a unique application with a lot of complexities. It uses JavaScript in some very unfamiliar ways to us who feel most comfortable in PHP, but this is good because it‚Äôs not just PHP written with JavaScript syntax; It‚Äôs a completely different language with different paradigms and ways to do things,&#8221; he told the Tavern.</p>
<p>Unlike many other areas of WordPress, there are not a lot of copy and paste solutions for the customizer. As a result of the WordPress Community Summit 2015, Ruter is making an effort to publish more articles on his <a href="https://make.xwp.co/">company&#8217;s site</a> that explain how to leverage specific features. For example, he recently <a href="https://make.xwp.co/2015/12/08/implementing-selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/">published an article</a> that explains how to implement selective refreshing.</p>
<h2>Give Weaver Xtreme a Try</h2>
<p>I encourage you to <a href="http://weavertheme.com/wordpress-customizer-supporting-600-theme-options/">read the entire case study</a> as there&#8217;s more to it than what&#8217;s written here. You should also try out <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/weaver-xtreme/">Weaver Xtreme</a> on a test site to experience what it&#8217;s like using the customizer with 600+ options. Wampler has proven that not only can the customizer scale with hundreds of options, it can do so at relatively fast speeds.</p>

<p>Today Automattic announced that the <a href="https://desktop.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress.com desktop app</a> is now open source and <a href="https://github.com/automattic/wp-desktop/" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> under the GPLv2 (or later). A Linux version joins the OS X and Windows apps that were released at the end of November and early December, making desktop publishing accessible to users on all major operating systems.</p>
<p>The apps provide a beautiful writing and editing experience that mirrors WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture. In addition to publishing, users can browse the Reader, manage sites, customize themes, and view stats.</p>
<p>According to the GitHub repository, the desktop app is an <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a> wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso" target="_blank">Calypso</a>. Electron is what turns the new JavaScript and API-powered WordPress.com into a native app. It is a framework based on Node.js and Chromium that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron was originally developed for GitHub&#8217;s Atom editor and then open sourced under the MIT license. Microsoft, Facebook, Slack, and Docker all have applications that use Electron.</p>
<p>The WordPress.com desktop app is split between Electron code and Calypso code, with Calypso running as a submodule. If you want to fork it to customize your own app, Automattic&#8217;s developers have written detailed instructions for <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/blob/master/docs/install.md" target="_blank">installing and running</a> the application.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/blob/master/docs/development.md" target="_blank">development guide</a> outlines the structure of the app, how it runs, where to make changes when customizing the main app, and how to debug your work. The repository also includes <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/blob/master/docs/packaging.md" target="_blank">instructions</a> for how to package your released version in a platform-specific way.</p>
<p>In the future the desktop app will become more robust as more admin screens are added to Calypso. This amazing body of work is available for anyone to use or repurpose as your own publishing app trimmed of WordPress.com&#8217;s extra features, such as stats, site management, and the Reader. For example, it would be interesting to see a bare bones fork that works with self-hosted sites without having to use Jetpack.</p>

This includes features such as semantic markup and structuring, screen reader texts and focus states on all interactive objects, high-contrast typography, and navigation suited for all input devices.</p>
<p>The theme is based on <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a>, a starter theme that already has accessibility baked in. Hendriksen also used Twenty Fifteen&#8217;s CSS and JavaScript to provide the menu, which works as a horizontal menu on wider screens.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49744"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper.png?resize=1025%2C769" alt="popper" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49744" /></a></p>
<p>Popper comes with a handful of options available in the native customizer, including support for a site icon, a 1600 √ó 420 header image, header text and background colors, an optional left or right sidebar, and a bottom widget area. If you don&#8217;t upload a site icon (which doubles as the global home button), the theme will show the first letter of the site title.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper-customizer.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49759"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper-customizer.png?resize=1025%2C570" alt="popper-customizer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49759" /></a></p>
<p>In a <a href="http://mor10.com/introducing-popper/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing the theme, Hendriksen outlined a few of the more subtle features that you might not notice immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS flex (a.k.a. ‚Äúflexbox) used for post navigation and widgets to create a more harmonious display of content, when the widget area is set to default, the width of individual widgets changes depending on how many widgets are added to provide a more interesting display.</li>
<li>The first post on the home page is displayed as full content with the option to truncate it using the More Tag.</li>
<li>Featured Images and center-aligned images are displayed as full-bleed content on smaller screens and center automatically on wider screens.</li>
<li>Posts can have an optional deck (summary) displayed directly under the post title, powered by the custom Excerpt feature in the post editor.</li>
<li>In-content links are highlighted using a grey underline that expands on :hover and :focus.</li>
<li>If a post author has a Gravatar associated with their email address, the Gravatar appears next to the post meta.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hendriksen&#8217;s blog is currently using Popper as the <a href="http://mor10.com/" target="_blank">live demo</a> for the theme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Popper started out as a simple idea: Build a beautiful content-focused theme that met or exceeded the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/" target="_blank">WordPress Accessibililty Guidelines</a>, and provide a user experience centered around how people visit the web today: with their thumbs on mobile devices,&#8221; Hendriksen said.</p>
<p>In order to make the design thumb-friendly, he moved the mobile menu button from the top left corner to the bottom left corner. The menu appears on top of the content, instead of displacing it. &#8220;As a result, the menu is always accessible and within reach regardless of what type of device or input method you choose to use,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper-mobile.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49750"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper-mobile.png?resize=932%2C666" alt="popper-mobile" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49750" /></a></p>
<p>Hendriksen, a philosophy nerd at heart, named the theme after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper" target="_blank">Karl Popper</a>, an Austrian-British philosopher of science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Popper became the namesake for this theme due to it‚Äôs basic premise of building on what has been done before and moving the world forward by introducing evolutionary and empirically falsifiable theories about how to improve the user experience through accessibility and a focus on the hands of the mobile user,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a mobile-first theme with touch-friendly navigation that meets all of the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/" target="_blank">WordPress Accessibility Guidelines</a>, Popper is an excellent choice. It also works well as a starting place for child themes. You can <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/popper/" target="_blank">download</a> it for free on WordPress.org.</p>
<p>Popper is also <a href="https://github.com/mor10/popper" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> and Hendriksen welcomes any contributions in form of pull requests, issues, feature requests, and translations. A full feature list is available on the theme&#8217;s <a href="http://mor10.com/popper/" target="_blank">home page</a>.</p>
